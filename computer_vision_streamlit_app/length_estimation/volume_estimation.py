VolumeEstimator Class Documentation:

Purpose:
The VolumeEstimator class is designed to estimate the volume of a structure based on orthogonal lines to a central skeleton. By understanding the cross-sectional area at various points along the length (represented by the orthogonal lines), the class approximates the volume of the entire structure.

How It Works:

1. Initialization:
   - The class is initialized with a dictionary of orthogonal lines and a distance value `h`.
   - The dictionary's keys represent the names of body parts (or segments), and the values are lists of orthogonal lines for that segment.
   - The distance `h` represents the distance between two consecutive orthogonal lines.

2. Calculate Cross-sectional Areas:
   - For each orthogonal line, the class calculates the area it represents by assuming the line's endpoints represent the diameter of a circular cross-section.
   - Area = Ï€ * (width/2)^2

3. Estimate Volume Between Two Lines:
   - The class computes the volume between two adjacent orthogonal lines by assuming the shape between them is a frustum of a cone.
   - Volume = (h/3) * (Area1 + Area2 + sqrt(Area1 * Area2))

4. Calculate Total Volume:
   - The class computes the total volume by summing up the volumes of all the sections defined by the orthogonal lines.

Usage:

orthogonal_lines = {
    "body_part_1": [line1, line2, ...],   # Actual lines for each body segment
    ...
}
h_value = ...  # Actual distance between the lines

estimator = VolumeEstimator(orthogonal_lines, h_value)
estimated_volume = estimator.calculate_volume()
